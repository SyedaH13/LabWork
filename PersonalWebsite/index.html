    <h4>Who am I?</h4>
     <p>
        
       I live in Hamtramck, Michigan, a very small and diverse city 
       within Detroit. I also have a cat, whom I spend a lot of time with. 
       I have a lot of varying interests, but mostly feel passionate about 
       the climate, solving problems, and enjoying new places. 
     </p>
    <h4>Experiences</h4>
     <p>
      Throughout my adult live, my varying interests have landed me in some pretty 
      interesting jobs. My favorite was working as an EMT in the city of Detroit. I also loved
      working in a local ER afterwards, on the admin side as a Communications Specialist. 
      Now, I am a Project Manager and am learning how to code at a bootcamp to become a developer.
